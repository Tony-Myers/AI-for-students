  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">What is AI Literacy for Students?</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    AI literacy is your ability to understand, evaluate, and effectively use AI technologies for learning. 
    As a student, this means knowing how to prompt AI tools effectively, recognising when outputs might be 
    inaccurate, and understanding how to integrate AI ethically into your academic work.

## Core Skills Section - Student Focus
Replace the academic-focused cards with student-specific examples:

```html
<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-50 to-blue-50 p-6 rounded border border-sky-200">
  <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-sky-700 mb-3">Smart Prompting for Study Success</h4>
  <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
    Learning to write clear, specific prompts that help you understand concepts, get feedback on your work, 
    and generate study materials. This is like learning to ask better questions.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-3 rounded text-sm text-slate-600">
    <strong>Student Example:</strong> Instead of "Help with my essay," try "I'm writing a 1500-word essay 
    about climate change impacts on food security. Can you help me create an outline with three main 
    arguments and suggest what evidence I should look for?"
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-50 to-green-50 p-6 rounded border border-emerald-200">
  <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-emerald-700 mb-3">Fact-Checking AI Outputs</h4>
  <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
    Developing your ability to spot potential errors, biases, or made-up information in AI responses. 
    This includes verifying sources and cross-checking important facts.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-3 rounded text-sm text-slate-600">
    <strong>Study Tip:</strong> Always verify any statistics, dates, or citations that AI provides. 
    Use tools like Google Scholar to confirm that sources actually exist and say what the AI claims.

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-orange-50 p-6 rounded border border-amber-200">

  <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
    Using AI to enhance your learning rather than replacing your thinking. This means using AI for 
    brainstorming, explaining concepts, and getting feedback whilst ensuring the final work is genuinely yours.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-3 rounded text-sm text-slate-600">
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Use AI to help you understand difficult concepts, generate practice questions, 
    and review your work - but always ensure you can explain and defend what you submit.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-50 to-pink-50 p-6 rounded border border-rose-200">

    following your institution's academic integrity policies.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-3 rounded text-sm text-slate-600">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Always check your university's AI policy before using these tools for 
    assessed work. When in doubt, ask your lecturer or declare your AI use.
