      AI can revolutionise how you approach research and writing, but it requires the right mindset. 
      Think of AI as a sophisticated research assistant that can help you find sources, understand 
      complex topics, organise your thoughts, and improve your writing - whilst you remain the author 
      and critical thinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      From brainstorming essay topics and finding relevant sources to getting feedback on your drafts 
      and ensuring proper citations, AI tools can support every stage of your research process. 
      The key is learning to use these tools ethically and effectively whilst developing your own 
      academic skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide will show you practical ways to integrate AI into your research workflow whilst 
      maintaining academic integrity and producing work that is genuinely your own.
