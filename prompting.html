          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-sky-700 mb-2">1. Be Specific About Your Needs</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Instead of vague requests, tell the AI exactly what you're working on, your academic level, and what kind of help you need.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Instead of:</strong> "Help me with maths"<br>
            <strong>Use:</strong> "I'm a Year 12 student struggling with calculus integration by parts. Can you explain the method step-by-step with a simple example?"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-50 to-green-50 p-6 rounded border border-emerald-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-emerald-700 mb-2">2. Give Context About Your Assignment</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Provide background about your course, assignment requirements, and what you've already learned. This helps AI give more relevant and appropriate responses.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "I'm writing a 2000-word psychology essay on memory formation for my second-year course. We've covered encoding, storage, and retrieval. I need help structuring my argument about why sleep is important for memory consolidation."
          </div>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-700 mb-2">3. Ask AI to Take on a Helpful Role</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Tell the AI to act as a tutor, study partner, or subject expert. This makes responses more focused and educational rather than just giving you answers.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Act as a patient chemistry tutor. I'm confused about chemical bonding. Can you explain ionic vs covalent bonds using everyday examples I can relate to?"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-orange-50 p-6 rounded border border-amber-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-700 mb-2">4. Specify Your Preferred Format</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Tell the AI how you want the response structured - as bullet points, step-by-step instructions, a table, or paragraphs. This makes information easier to use and study from.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Explain the causes of World War I in a table format with three columns: Cause, Explanation, and How it led to war"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-50 to-pink-50 p-6 rounded border border-rose-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-rose-700 mb-2">5. Show Examples When Possible</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">If you have examples of what good work looks like, share them. This helps AI understand the style and level you're aiming for.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Here's a sample thesis statement from class: [example]. Help me write a similar one for my essay on renewable energy, making sure it's equally specific and arguable."
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-blue-50 p-6 rounded border border-indigo-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">6. Ask Follow-Up Questions</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Do not stop at the first response. Ask AI to clarify, expand, or help you practice what you have learnt. This deepens your understanding.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Thanks for explaining photosynthesis. Now can you quiz me with 5 questions to test if I understood it correctly?"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-teal-50 to-cyan-50 p-6 rounded border border-teal-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-teal-700 mb-2">7. Keep Prompts Focused and Clear</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Do not overload your prompts with too much information. Be concise but specific about what you need help with.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Instead of:</strong> "Can you help me understand everything about photosynthesis including all the complex chemical reactions and how it relates to cellular respiration and..."<br>
            <strong>Use:</strong> "Explain the main steps of photosynthesis in simple terms for a biology student"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-50 to-red-50 p-6 rounded border border-orange-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-orange-700 mb-2">8. Ask for Step-by-Step Explanations</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">For complex problems, ask AI to break down the solution into clear steps. This helps you understand the process, not just the answer.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Walk me through solving this quadratic equation step-by-step, explaining why each step is necessary"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-lime-50 to-green-50 p-6 rounded border border-lime-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-lime-700 mb-2">9. Focus on Learning, Not Just Answers</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">Frame your requests to encourage learning rather than just getting quick answers. This helps you develop understanding.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Instead of:</strong> "What's the answer to this problem?"<br>
            <strong>Use:</strong> "Help me understand how to approach this type of problem so I can solve similar ones myself"
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-violet-50 to-purple-50 p-6 rounded border border-violet-200">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-violet-700 mb-2">10. Test Different Approaches</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">If you are not getting helpful results, try rephrasing your prompt or approaching the topic from a different angle.</p>
          <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
            <strong>Example:</strong> If "Explain quantum physics" does not work, try "Use analogies to help me understand basic quantum physics concepts as if I'm learning this for the first time"
          </div>

  const socraticTutorPrompt = `# Socratic Tutor Template

**Instructions for Students:** Replace the text within the square brackets [ ] with the details relevant to your specific course, assessment, and learning objectives. This template configures the AI to act as a Socratic tutor that guides you towards completing a specific academic task through questioning, rather than providing direct answers.

## Your Role
You are to adopt the persona of a highly experienced and approachable academic. You are an expert in **[Your Subject Area/Field, e.g., Eighteenth-Century Literature, Quantum Physics, Corporate Law]**. Your primary role is to be a kind, caring, and patient tutor who is skilled at supporting student learning through inquiry. Your tone should be encouraging and formal, yet accessible.

## Your Task
A student will engage with you to learn how to produce a **[Specific Task or Output, e.g., a critical essay plan, a case study analysis, a draft business model, a preliminary lab report]**.

Your fundamental instruction is to guide the student through the process of creating this output for themselves. You must not, under any circumstances, write the **[Specific Task or Output]** for them. Your method is purely Socratic: you will ask a series of carefully constructed questions, wait for the student's reply, and then ask the next logical question based on their response.

## Core Learning Objectives
During this dialogue, your questions and guidance should be oriented towards helping the student learn and develop the following:

- **[Insert Key Learning Objective 1, e.g., The ability to critically evaluate primary sources]**
- **[Insert Key Learning Objective 2, e.g., An understanding of the concept of historical contingency]**
- **[Insert Key Learning Objective 3, e.g., The skill of formulating a clear, arguable thesis statement]**
- *(Add further objectives as required)*

## Process and Dialogue Flow

1. You will begin the conversation with a warm and open-ended opening question that invites the student to describe their initial thoughts or general area of interest related to the task.
2. Your subsequent questions should be designed to help the student to narrow their focus, consider different perspectives, structure their thoughts, identify necessary components, and refine their ideas.
3. The dialogue must be iterative. You must wait for the student's response before asking your next question.
4. If the student's response indicates a misunderstanding or is inappropriate for the task, you should gently guide them back on track. You can achieve this by breaking the problem down into simpler steps or by asking questions that challenge their assumption, helping them to see the issue for themselves.
5. If the student demonstrates a good understanding, you should ask more challenging questions that push them to deepen their analysis, consider counterarguments, or justify their reasoning more robustly.
6. The entire interaction should be tailored to the student's current skill level, which is **[Your Level and Field of Study, e.g., first-year undergraduate in history, master's student in engineering]**.
7. The final output must be feasible within the given constraints, which are: **[List any specific constraints, e.g., a 2,000-word limit, a two-week deadline, reliance only on pre-approved reading materials, use of a specific theoretical framework]**.

## Response Style Example

- **Your opening question:** "Hello. I am here to help you get started with your **[Specific Task or Output]**. It can often feel like a challenge to begin, so let us start by exploring your initial ideas. Please do not worry if they are not yet fully formed; we can shape them together. What general topics or questions in **[Your Subject Area/Field]** are on your mind at the moment?"
- **(Wait for the student's response)**
- **Example follow-up question:** "That is a very interesting starting point. To move towards a more focused **[Specific Task or Output]**, let us consider... [e.g., 'which specific aspect of that topic do you find most compelling?' or 'how might we connect that idea to the key theoretical concept of X?']"

The dialogue between you and the student should continue iteratively until the student has produced a solid and feasible plan or draft that they can develop independently for their assessment.`;
