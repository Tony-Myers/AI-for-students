## Updated Principle Cards with Student Examples
Replace principle cards with student-focused examples:

```html
<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-50 to-blue-50 p-6 rounded border border-sky-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-sky-700 mb-2">1. Be Specific About Your Needs</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    Instead of vague requests, tell the AI exactly what you're working on, your academic level, 
    and what kind of help you need.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Instead of:</strong> "Help me with maths"<br>
    <strong>Use:</strong> "I'm a Year 12 student struggling with calculus integration by parts. 
    Can you explain the method step-by-step with a simple example?"
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-50 to-green-50 p-6 rounded border border-emerald-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-emerald-700 mb-2">2. Give Context About Your Assignment</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    Provide background about your course, assignment requirements, and what you've already learned. 
    This helps AI give more relevant and appropriate responses.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Example:</strong> "I'm writing a 2000-word psychology essay on memory formation for my 
    second-year course. We've covered encoding, storage, and retrieval. I need help structuring 
    my argument about why sleep is important for memory consolidation."
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-violet-50 p-6 rounded border border-purple-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-purple-700 mb-2">3. Ask AI to Take on a Helpful Role</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    Tell the AI to act as a tutor, study partner, or subject expert. This makes responses more 
    focused and educational rather than just giving you answers.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Example:</strong> "Act as a patient chemistry tutor. I'm confused about chemical bonding. 
    Can you explain ionic vs covalent bonds using everyday examples I can relate to?"
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-orange-50 p-6 rounded border border-amber-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-amber-700 mb-2">4. Specify Your Preferred Format</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    Tell the AI how you want the response structured - as bullet points, step-by-step instructions, 
    a table, or paragraphs. This makes information easier to use and study from.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Example:</strong> "Explain the causes of World War I in a table format with three columns: 
    Cause, Explanation, and How it led to war"
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-50 to-pink-50 p-6 rounded border border-rose-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-rose-700 mb-2">5. Show Examples When Possible</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    If you have examples of what good work looks like, share them. This helps AI understand 
    the style and level you're aiming for.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Example:</strong> "Here's a sample thesis statement from class: [example]. Help me write 
    a similar one for my essay on renewable energy, making sure it's equally specific and arguable."
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-blue-50 p-6 rounded border border-indigo-200">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">6. Ask Follow-Up Questions</h3>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-2">
    Don't stop at the first response. Ask AI to clarify, expand, or help you practice what you've learned. 
    This deepens your understanding.
  </p>
  <div class="bg-white/60 p-2 rounded text-xs text-slate-600">
    <strong>Example:</strong> "Thanks for explaining photosynthesis. Now can you quiz me with 5 questions 
    to test if I understood it correctly?"
  </div>
</div>
```
