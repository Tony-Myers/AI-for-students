      AI tools offer unprecedented opportunities to personalise your learning experience. 
      From creating custom study materials and practice tests to getting instant explanations 
      of difficult concepts, AI can adapt to your unique learning style and pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key is knowing how to integrate these tools effectively into your study routine. 
      This means using AI to enhance your understanding and retention, not to replace the 
      critical thinking and deep learning that leads to academic success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below you'll find practical strategies organised around different aspects of the learning 
      process. Each section includes specific techniques you can implement immediately to 
      improve your study effectiveness.
